# ASTR3110 Tutorials - Data Science Techniques in Astrophysics

Tutorials for the ASTR3110 course cover visualisation, statistics,
machine-learning and general data-analysis techniques. They are
conducted using the Python language and are designed to prepare
students for the practical projects during the year.

## Tutorial Topics

 * WK1: Probability and Statistics
 * WK2: Manipulating, visualising and cleaning data (Pandas)
 * WK3: Fitting a model to data: simple regression, maximum likelihood (MCMC)
 * WK4: Modelling data: Bayesian reasoning and samplers (Nested Sampling), advanced regression.
 * WK5: Exploring structure in data: visualisation, PCA
 * WK6: Exploring structure in data: KNN & tSne
 * WK7: Exploring structure in data: GMMs
 * WK8: Classification: decision trees and random forest
 * WK9: Artificial neural networks
 * WK10: Convolutional neural networks
 * WK11: Time-series analysis
 * WK12: Revision

Tutorials start in Week 1 and run until Week 11, covering new topics
each week. Week 12 will host a revision tutorial covering material
from previous weeks.

## Technical Setup

Most tutorials will be run via Jupyter Notebooks inside Google
Colab. Instructions for setting up Colab are in the
[SETUP_COLAB](SETUP_COLAB.md) file.
